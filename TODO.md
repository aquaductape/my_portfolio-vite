interactivity for fullname-logo: type click: spiral pattern: http://jsfiddle.net/jingshaochen/xJc7M/, zig-zag (like harry potter scar) and in left|right|top|bottom direction, tight tiled. During animation don't enable mouse move, until it is done, But clicking will interrupt and change to next animation.

make shadow follow on tab, remove pointer events none could be an a11y issue cuz it wont set focus to header context. Have mouseover on body instead, it's okay since it will be disabled when past observer

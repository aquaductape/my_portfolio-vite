interactivity for fullname-logo: type click: spiral pattern: http://jsfiddle.net/jingshaochen/xJc7M/, zig-zag (like harry potter scar) and in left|right|top|bottom direction, tight tiled. During animation don't enable mouse move, until it is done, But clicking will interrupt and change to next animation.

take screenshot when devtools is opened. Strategy: use window resize, not the best, but currently the only best solution and is cross browser https://stackoverflow.com/a/41627911/8234457

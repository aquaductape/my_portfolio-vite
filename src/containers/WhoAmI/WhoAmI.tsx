          Growing up I have lived in different places such as England and
          Tajikistan. Experiencing different environments are highlights in my
          childhood.

          I got hooked into Web development several years ago and stayed since
          because it's an evolving crazy beast.

          Tech/standards become deprecated, while new ones either replace or
          disrupt them. You gotta make sure your intricate app works anywhere,
          is fast and has solid design.{" "}

          When I'm not coding, I enjoy hanging out with family and friends,
          especially during the holidays!
